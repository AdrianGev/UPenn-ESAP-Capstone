## Out of Stock (Fish) -- Chess Engine
Chess engine that uses the minimax algo and alpha-beta pruning to find the best move for the computer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.7
- Pygame 2.6.1

And that's it lol

## Resources Used
[Creating a Chess Engine in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_).

This was insanely helpful for figuring out the engine. This series was used as a reference point for the engine.
